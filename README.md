# CSV2Points

**CSV to Points on Bing Image Service:** Quickly view latitude/longitude points on a high resolution imagery service. This app was created to be shared with project partners to quickly view tabular data (CSV) without the need of a specialist to convert and map the data. The Bing imagery service was used as the basemap because it is much better (more cloud free tiles) in the Amazon Basin than Google Maps/Earth, but Bing Maps doesn't currently have the ability to upload tabular or spatial data to view on the service.

The app was used by Field Museum staff and project partners in Colombia and Peru to select overflight points during the planning process of a Rapid Inventory in the Bajo Putumayo basin.
